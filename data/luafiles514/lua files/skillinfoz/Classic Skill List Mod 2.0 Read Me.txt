Classic Skill List Mod 2.0 - By Rytech
Date of Finalized Creation - March 12, 2011

What does this mod do?
--------------------------------
This mod uses edited decompiled Lub files to modify the arrangement
of the skills in the skill window. The mod gets its name from the fact
it reorganizes all the skills to be in ID order, which is the way the
skills were organized before the skill tree view existed long ago.

In order to do this, each skill had to have its skill tree view slot
placement number changed. In the past this was difficult to do 1 by 1
which lead to problems. With V2.0 it was very easy to do. The tree file
is no longer wiped and is instead entirely edited so the tree view will
retain its features for showing prerequired skills and their levels when
hilighting skills.

The jobinheritlist.lub file was also edited to help the mod work. Fake ID's
were added to help create fake trees that were needed to help place all the
2nd job regular skills, trans skills, and quest skills in order. To do this,
I had to change the Lord Knight job for example to inherit a fake Knight skill
tree. By doing this I can place all the skills for both Knight and Lord Knight
in the Lord Knight's tree while using a fake empty Knight tree (Named KNIGHT_F).

You will see some dummy data added in the files. Do not remove anything with
the _F prefix at the end or it will mess up the inheriting and the trees.
--------------------------------

How to install and use the mod?
--------------------------------
The files are to be placed in the data/lua files/skillinfoz/ directory.
The files are not compiled, but can be used as is without the need of 
compiling. It is recommanded you use a 2010-06-16 RE client or higher
for this mod as it was developed with that client and lower ones may not
work. (Why would you use outdated ones anyway?)

If you find any bugs, report them to my topic on eAthena or 3CeAM.
