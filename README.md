# What is this?
---  
rDukieAthenaClient is a modified client for the game Ragnarok hosted on a modified forked rathena server (git@github.com:afable/rDukieAthena).

The full client includes a large .grf data file (containing all the sprites, maps, etc.) and can be downloaded from google drive: TBD.
